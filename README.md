# Recommender-System-Framework
A sophisticated Recommender System that provides recommendations to users on different datasets available like GroupLens, Amazon, Goodreads, using a hybrid recommender system engine. The framework allows the user to configure their recommender system with a precision recall tuning component to increase the accuracy of recommendations. To assist a variety of datasets, the framework also included a Data Source component.

# Framework Components:
1. Data Source (Which takes up different types of data sets and makes it ready for the engine)
3. Recommender Engine (A combination of different recommender system algorithms according for user to test: Training and Testing of datasesets)
4. Feedback Loop (Prediction accuracy is increased with precision recall tuning component)

# Database
1. Scalable back-end DB with Mongo DB

# Algorithms Supported
1. Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
2. Content-Based Filtering Algorithm - with item and/or user vectors 
3. Bayesian classification Algorithm
